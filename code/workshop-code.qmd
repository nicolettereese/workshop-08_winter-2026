In this workshop, we will answer the question: How do specific leaf area, water treatment, and species influence plant mass?  

**Specific leaf area** is a continuous variable measured in cm^2^/g.  

**Water treatment** is a categorical variable (i.e. a *factor*) with 2 levels: drought stressed (DS) and well watered (WW).  

**Species** is a categorical variable (again, a *factor*) with 7 levels.  

| Species name                 | Species code | Common name        |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| _Encelia californica_        | ENCCAL       | Bush sunflower     |  
| _Eschscholzia californica_   | ESCCAL       | California poppy   | 
| _Penstemon centranthifolius_ | PENCEN       | Scarlet bugler     | 
| _Grindelia camporums_        | GRINCAM      | Gumweed            | 
| _Salvia leucophylla_         | SALLEU       | Purple sage        | 
| _Stipa pulchra_              | STIPUL       | Purple needlegrass | 
| _Lotus scoparius_            | LOTSCO       | Deerweed           |

Insert code to display 10 random rows from the data frame here.  

```{r}
#| label: displaying rows in dataframe

slice_sample(
  drought_exp_clean,
  n = 10
)


```




# 3. Visualizing data

## What is the relationship between SLA and plant mass?  

Make a scatterplot to visualize SLA (the predictor) on the x-axis, and total mass (the response) on the y-axis.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the relationship (e.g. as SLA increases, total mass ______). 

```{r}
#| label: sla and mass plot
# creating base plot
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean,
       aes(x = sla,
           y = total_g)) +
# adding in points
    geom_point(color = "#50a492") + 
# labeling axes
  labs(x = "Specific leaf area (cm\U00B2/g)",
       y = "Total mass (g)",
       title = "As specific leaf area increases, total mass increases")
```




## What are the differences in total mass between water treatments?

Make a jitterplot to visualize the differences in plant mass between water treatments.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the differences in (mean or median) plant mass between water treatments.


```{r}
#| label: water treatment and mass plot
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean,
       aes(x = water_treatment,
           y = total_g,
           color = water_treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0,
              width = 0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Drought stressed" = ds_col,
    "Well watered" = ww_col
  )) + 
  labs(x = "Water treatment",
       y = "Total mass (g)",
       title = "On average, plant mass in well watered treatment\nis higher than plant mass in drought stressed\ntreatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```





## What are the differences in total mass between species?

Make a jitterplot to visualize the differences in plant mass between species.  

Label the axes with units where appropriate.  

Add a title describing the differences in (mean or median) plant mass between species.  

Bonus: order the x-axis by decreasing mean plant mass _and_ wrap the long species names using the `label_wrap()` function from the `scales` package.


```{r}
#| label: species and mass plot
#base layer
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean,
       aes(x = species_name,
           y = total_g,
           color = species_name)) +
#jitter to represent individual seedlings across species
 geom_jitter(height = 0,
              width = 0.2) +
#use custon colors for points
 scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Lotus scoparius" = lotsco_col,
    "Penstemon centranthifolius" = pencen_col,
    "Salvia leucophylla" = salleu_col,
    "Encelia californica" = enccal_col,
    "Stipa pulchra" = stipul_col,
    "Eschscholzia californica" = esccal_col,
    "Grindelia camporum" = gricam_col
  )) +
#wrap long x-axis labels
  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(10)) +
#relabel axis titles
  labs(x = "Species name",
       y = "Total mass (g)",
       title = "Plant mass differs across species") +
#take out legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```






# 4. Fitting models

8 models total:

| Model number | SLA | Water treatment | Species | Predictor list              |  
|--------------|:---:|:---------------:|:-------:|:---------------------------:|  
| 0            |     |                 |         | no predictors (null model)  |
| 1            |  X  |       X         |    X    | all predictors (full model) | 
| 2            |  X  |       X         |         | SLA and water treatment     |   
| 3            |  X  |                 |    X    | SLA and species             |    
| 4            |     |       X         |    X    | water treatment and species |    
| 5            |  X  |                 |         | SLA                         |    
| 6            |     |       X         |         | water treatment             |    
| 7            |     |                 |    X    | species                     |

## Model fitting

```{r}
#| label: model fitting

# model 0: null model, no predictors
model0 <- lm(
  total_g ~ 1,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 1: all predictors
model1 <- lm(
  total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 2: SLA and water treatment
model2 <- lm(
  total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 3: SLA and species
model3 <- lm(
  total_g ~ sla + species_name,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 4: water treatment and species
model4 <- lm(
  total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 5: SLA
model5 <- lm(
  total_g ~ sla,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 6: water treatment
model6 <- lm(
  total_g ~ water_treatment,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)

# model 7: species
model7 <- lm(
  total_g ~ species_name,
  data = drought_exp_clean
)
```

## Model selection

Insert code to use the `AICc()` function to calculate the AIC for each model.  

Arrange by decreasing AIC.

```{r}
#| label: model selection


AICc(
  model0, 
  model1,
  model2,
  model3,
  model4,
  model5,
  model6,
  model7
) |> 
  arrange(AICc)


```

The best model to describe variation in plant mass only includes water treatment and species. 

## Model diagnostics

Insert code to look at the diagnostic plots for the best model.

```{r}
#| label: checking diagnostics

par(mfrow = c(2,2)) #display plots in a 2x2 grid
plot(model4) #model to check diagnostics

```

Diagnostic plots look good.

Residuals (standing in for errors) look normally distributed based on QQ plot. 

Residuals look homoscedastic (have constant variance) based on Residuals vs Fitted plot and Scale-Location plot.

No outliers influencing model estimates of coefficients


## Summary

Insert code to display the summary for the best model. 

```{r}
#| label: looking at model summary

summary(model4)

```


**What are the reference levels?**  

Drought stressed is the reference level for water treatment, and Lotus scoparius is the reference level for species name. (this is the way the levels were set in fct_relevel)

**What does the `(Intercept)` represent?**  

The intercept is the model prediction for plant mass for Lotus scoparius in the drought stressed treatment. The model predicts that Lotus scoparius mass in the drought stressed treatment will be 0.055 $\pm$ 0.025 (SE) g. 

**What does `water_treatmentWell watered` represent?**

This is the model prediction for the difference in Lotus scoparius mass between the well watered and drought stressed treatments. The model predicts that this difference is 0.12 $\pm$ 0.017 g. 

**What does `species_namePenstemon centranthifolius` represent?**  

This is the model prediction for the difference between Penstemon centranthifolius in the well watered treatment and Lotus scoparius mass in the well watered treatment. The model predicts that this difference is 0.05 $\pm$ 0.03 g.

**What does `species_nameEschscholzia californica` represent?**

This is the model prediction for the difference between Eschscholzia californica mass in the well watered treatment and Lotus scoparius mass in the well watered treatment. The model predicts that this difference is 0.23 $\pm$ 0.03 g. 


## Stop and think: what does this model mean?  

**What is the best model?**

The best model includes water treatment and species as predictors.

**How much variation in the response (total mass, in grams) does this model explain?**

72.6% of the variation in plant mass can be explained by this model.

**How do we interpret the effects of the predictors on the response variable (again, total mass in grams)?**

Treatment influences plant mass.

Species influences plant mass. 

# 4. Model predictions

Insert code to generate model predictions for the best model.  

Rename the `x` column and `group` column to match the original data frame (`drought_exp_clean`).

Look at the object before plotting.

```{r}
#| label: generate predictions

preds <- ggpredict(
  model4,
  terms = c("water_treatment", "species_name")
) |> 
  rename(water_treatment = x,
         species_name = group)


```


# 5. Final figure

Create a clean, publication ready figure depicting predictions for the best model and the underlying data.


```{r}
#| label: final figure
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 12
ggplot(data = drought_exp_clean,
       aes(x = water_treatment,
           y = total_g,
           color = water_treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0,
              width = 0.2,
              alpha = 0.4,
              shape = 21) +
  geom_pointrange(data = preds,
                  aes(x = water_treatment,
                      y = predicted,
                      ymin = conf.low,
                      ymax = conf.high)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Drought stressed" = ds_col,
    "Well watered" = ww_col
  )) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap(10)) +
  labs(x = "Water treatment",
       y = "Total mass (g)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~ species_name,
             nrow = 1)
```
